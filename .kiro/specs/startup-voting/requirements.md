# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables authenticated users to vote on startup pitches with thumbs up or thumbs down votes. Users can vote once per pitch but can change their vote, and all users can view vote counts on the pitch details page. This will help users gauge community sentiment and engagement with different startup ideas.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to vote thumbs up or thumbs down on a startup pitch, so that I can express my opinion about the idea.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user views a pitch details page THEN the system SHALL display voting buttons (thumbs up and thumbs down)
2. WHEN an authenticated user clicks a voting button THEN the system SHALL record their vote
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user views a pitch details page THEN the system SHALL NOT display voting buttons
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prevent voting actions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to vote only once per pitch, so that the voting system remains fair and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has already voted on a pitch THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate votes
2. WHEN a user attempts to vote on a pitch they've already voted on THEN the system SHALL show their existing vote state
3. IF a user has voted thumbs up THEN the system SHALL highlight the thumbs up button as active
4. IF a user has voted thumbs down THEN the system SHALL highlight the thumbs down button as active

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to change my vote on a pitch, so that I can update my opinion if it changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the opposite vote button from their current vote THEN the system SHALL update their vote
2. WHEN a user clicks the same vote button as their current vote THEN the system SHALL remove their vote
3. WHEN a user changes their vote THEN the system SHALL update the vote counts immediately
4. WHEN a user removes their vote THEN the system SHALL update the vote counts immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As any user (authenticated or not), I want to see the current vote counts on a pitch, so that I can understand community sentiment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user views a pitch details page THEN the system SHALL display the current thumbs up count
2. WHEN any user views a pitch details page THEN the system SHALL display the current thumbs down count
3. WHEN vote counts change THEN the system SHALL update the displayed counts immediately
4. IF a pitch has no votes THEN the system SHALL display zero for both counts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want votes to only appear on pitch details pages, so that the voting interface doesn't clutter other views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a pitch list or card view THEN the system SHALL NOT display voting buttons or counts
2. WHEN a user views a pitch details page THEN the system SHALL display voting interface and counts
3. WHEN a user navigates between different pages THEN the system SHALL only show voting on pitch details pages
